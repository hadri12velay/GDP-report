\subsection{Project Life Cycle and Relevance}

This project is the first iteration of the University of Southampton building a downwind faster than the wind vehicle, with no record of previous work taking place. The current project aimed to design and manufacture a vehicle that could be tested at the University's facilities. This project aimed to understand the workings of a downwind faster than the wind vehicle and produce a starting point for projects within the University focused on downwind faster than the wind motion.



\subsection{Project Context}

With the global transportation market moving towards more sustainable forms of travel, the demand for renewable energies is becoming ever-growing. The potentially self-sustaining nature of these vehicles offers opportunities in the transportation sector to provide a green alternative to fossil fuels. In their current form, these vehicles are still early in development and do not provide a convenient solution, but a significant input into design could see many aspects implemented into sustainable travel in the future. The mechanical systems involved with these vehicles are not limited to land vehicles, with revisions in design being applicable to watercraft.
