\subsection{Project structure}

Analysing the requirements of the vehicle helped visualise the four main components of the project: structure, propeller, drivetrain, and pitch control mechanism. A high level of communication was required and, therefore, maintained between the teams working on the different components of the prototype. From the outset of the project, it was planned that the vehicle would be tested experimentally, therefore, planning of the experimental setups began during the later stage of the design process.

Once the designs were complete, manufacturing the drivetrain became an integral part of the project to ensure that the vehicle would be ready for the wind tunnel test. More focus was put on manufacturing to increase progress made on the vehicle before testing. To ensure all aspects of testing were accounted for, an emphasis was put on planning. After deciding on using the wind tunnel facility, a comprehensive plan was laid out for the tests, data collection and data processing.

Once the first wind tunnel test was complete, it was clear that there were still aspects of the vehicle that needed changing prior to the second test. Furthermore, with the overall timescale for the project reducing, it was important to start the analysis of the project outputs. Between wind tunnel tests the focus shifted to improving the vehicle and testing the new features that were implemented.

\subsection{Design Methodology}

The design methodology for the project focused on employing an iterative method to maximize the outcomes for the vehicle. Following Figure \ref{fig:desmeth} the project was run through this process, ensuring that each stage of design was evaluated properly and that additions to the design were thought out adequately. The project was conducted on a limited budget which enhanced the need to design the vehicle thoughtfully and limit the number of prototypes. Enhancing the vehicle by adding singular improvements sequentially helped reduce the budgetary requirements of the project and reduce overall costs. Working through the structure laid out in Figure \ref{fig:desmeth} was facilitated by the modular nature of the vehicle, as slight improvements could be well thought out before being implementation. Strong communication within the team was important as the performance of the prototype was highly dependent on the synergy between each of its components.

This project was run in three main phases: design, manufacture and testing. During the design phase, research was conducted on the various components of the vehicle. This was done in an effort to better understand the workings of the concept as well as maximize the performance of the final output. After research was completed, the information gathered was used in the flow chart of Figure \ref{fig:desmeth} to design the basic vehicle and then iterate through to finalize the project. After completion, the designs were sent to EDMC for manufacturing and finalized post receiving components. The final phase of the project was to test the vehicle, looking at evaluating the performance and understanding the limitations of the design.
