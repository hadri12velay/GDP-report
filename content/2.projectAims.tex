\subsection{Project Aims}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Design, build and test a wind-powered vehicle capable of travelling downwind faster than the wind with the vehicle able to be tested in the University's wind tunnel facilities.
    \item Gain a better understanding of downwind faster than the wind vehicles and the parameters that influence their performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Project Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
\item Research all aspects of the vehicle, considering the performance losses at each state to make suitable and justifiable design decisions.
\item Understand the forces acting on the vehicle and explain how the vehicle functions.
\item Design an efficient drivetrain that can transfer rotational energy from the wheels to the propeller.
\item Design a system to vary the pitch of the propeller blades.
\item Design a modular vehicle that allows for modifications and developments during the project, after testing but also in further projects.
\item Complete the vehicle within budget.
\item Test the vehicle in the wind tunnel to acquire data on its performance.
\item Analyse wind tunnel data to validate theory/inform on areas of discrepancy and improvement
\end{itemize}
