\subsection{Project Aims}

Main aim project aim: To design, manufacture a downwind faster than the wind vehicle that can achieve higher speed than the relative wind.
Gain a better understanding of downwind faster than the wind vehicles and the parameters that influence their performances.
Build a foundation to take part in the Aeolus racing competition.

\subsection{Project Objectives}

To design an efficient drivetrain that can transfer rotational moments from the wheels to the propeller
\\To visualise the energy balances of the vehicle and explain how the vehicle functions
\\Use the wind tunnel to collect efficiency values for the vehicle
\\Use the wind tunnel facilities to test the vehicles performance
\\Design a system to vary the pitch of the propeller blades
\\Design a modular vehicle that allows for changes and developments for the project after the tests and for further projects 
\\Design the vehicle within budget
\\Research all aspects of the vehicle, considering the losses at each state to make the best design decisions
