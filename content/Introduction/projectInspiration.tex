Major inspiration for this project came from a YouTube video uploaded by Veritasium (a well-known science and engineering channel) focussed on a DWFTTW vehicle called BlackBird. Its inventors, Rick Cavallaro and John Borton, demonstrated their vehicle on the Ivanpah dry lake bed, south of Las Vegas, and achieved almost three times wind speed. Despite numerous demonstrations of DWFTTW vehicles beating wind-speed, scepticism among the scientific community exists to this day, with the commonly held belief that a vehicle with faster-than-wind capabilities would be a perpetual motion device, violating the first law of thermodynamics. One of the ways to tackle this scepticism is to make such vehicles more widely known by building and demonstrating additional working prototypes.
