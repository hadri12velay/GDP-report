Design criteria   & \cellcolor[HTML]{\CellColor}Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \\ \hline
Durability        & The durability of the vehicle was important to the project as developing a vehicle that is resilient and doesn’t deteriorate over time would allow for more testing. Having a vehicle that lasts the entire wind tunnel testing schedule is critical for this project as this would allow us to analyse data and complete the project aim of understanding the physical attributes of a downwind vehicle. \\ \hline
Cost              & The overall budget of the project was £850, which gave the project a constraint on the amount that we can feasibly spend on the vehicle. For this criterion it was critical to complete a vehicle under the amount of money available.\\ \hline
Manufacturability & As physically testing the vehicle in the R.J. Mitchell wind tunnel was set out as a goal from the outset of the project, ensuring the feasibility of manufacture of the vehicle was key.                                                                                                                                                                \\ \hline
Design            & The design of the vehicle needs to be well thought out as part of a suitable design process and any design decision justified accordingly with supporting data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\ \hline
Performance       & The vehicle performance was a key factor for the project as seeing what thrust levels and efficiencies were part of the vehicle will help us understand the limitations of the concept. We aim to see the vehicle generating some level of thrust and acceleration within a range of speeds during the testing phase.                                                                                     \\ \hline
Aesthetics        & The aesthetics of the vehicle do not affect the performance when testing, but generally a good-looking vehicle was preferred as this was seen as a sign of a good project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\ \hline
Complexity        & Minimizing the complexity of the vehicle will help the project as this will ensure that the vehicle will be able to be manufactured in time for the wind tunnel testing. Following this, basic concepts are easier to analyse with simpler designs which was though to be a priority for testing during the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\ \hline
Safety            & Ensuring that the students and facility members are safe was a key focus for the project. Ensuring that all aspects of the project are safe before testing is critical and risk assessment will be completed before testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\ \hline
Modularity        & Having a vehicle that can be adapted easily will help the design process and allow for updates to be made to the vehicle. Having a vehicle that can be adapted with during the project will help the progress of the vehicle and enhance the project outcomes.                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\ \hline
