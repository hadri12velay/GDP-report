\textbf{1}      & Stronger connection, less material used, added structural components to   the horizontal stabilisers. & Deformation with the vehicle oscillation possible, more pressure on   ensuring that the measurements are connect \\ \hline
\textbf{2}      & Mitigated deformation, as the bars are connected to two parts that are   mounted on the axle          & Increased material use, more cuts of the bar to manufacture                                                      \\ \hline
