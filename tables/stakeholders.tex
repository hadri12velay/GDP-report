\textbf{Supervisors} &
  Organising weekly meetings with the project supervisors and giving them presentations on the progress of the project in each period was key to the progress of the project. Asking questions and receiving feedback on progress allows for the supervisors to provide detailed analysis and suggestions for improvements for the project. The supervisor's interest in the project is derived from their involvement in the Engineering discipline as researchers at the University &
  This project is derived from the downwind faster than the wind vehicle blackbird created by Rick Cavallaro. The supervisors affect the design of the vehicle directly by inputting their expertise into the project, helping the team understand flaws in their methods \\ \hline
\textbf{Team members} &
  The team members need to stay in contact constantly throughout the project to ensure the project runs   smoothly. Deciding the team roles early on was key for the project as it allowed each team member to know whom to contact with different issues. &
  The team members oversee running the project and ensure the final prototype is up to the standard. The aim is to create a downwind faster than the wind vehicle that runs at the highest speed as is possible. The team were in charge of building the vehicle and will therefore have direct input throughout the project on the design and were the largest contributors affecting the final outcome \\ \hline
\textbf{EDMC} &
  The EDMC team oversaw the manufacturing of all complex components for the vehicle. It was required for the team to stay in contact with the EDMC constantly while parts were being manufactured to ensure that appropriate timescales were upheld for job completion and when they needed any additional information for jobs. &
  The EDMC team were interested in all GDP projects for the university especially in completing project outputs and testing. They have a duty to help each team therefore want to complete all tasks in time as efficiently as possible. Ensuring that the communication was clear was key for this stakeholder as many jobs are submitted to the EDMC throughout the year. This stakeholder has an influence on the design of the project, as over-complicated designs require revision to successfully manufacture components\\ \hline
\textbf{Wind Tunnel team} &
  The main contact for the wind tunnel was David Marshall, the wind tunnel manager. Staying in weekly   contact with him throughout the project was helpful in maintaining a relationship with the facility team and ensuring that all members know the project well, allowing them to help the functionality of test days and achieve better results. &
  The wind tunnel team are interested in the project as the vehicle was run in the RJ Mitchell test   facility. They wanted to ensure that the project didn't damage their wind tunnel, therefore affecting the design by ensuring that the vehicle is safe. They were also interested in the practical outcome of the vehicle due to their involvement in aerodynamic testing. \\ \hline
\textbf{Suppliers} &
  The communication with any possible supplier was held until the components were needed for the vehicle. The frequency of the communications varied depending on the issues that arose from the designing and testing of the vehicle &
  The main interest of the suppliers of components was selling the product to the group. After the components were bought, their interest was directed to the component remaining functional for the buyer. \\ \hline
